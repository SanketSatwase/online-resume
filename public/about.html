    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Sanket, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design
      and a knack for bringing ideas to life through code. My journey in web
      development began with a curiosity for how websites work, and it has since
      evolved into a full-fledged career that I absolutely love.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently completing an extensive web development course that has
      equipped me with a diverse set of skills and knowledge. Throughout this
      comprehensive program, I have mastered a wide range of tools and
      technologies, including both front-end and back-end development. My
      expertise spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, and modern frameworks such as
      React.js. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in backend technologies
      like Node.js, Express.js, and various database management systems,
      including SQL and PostgreSQL.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the highlights of my training has been working with cutting-edge
      technologies like Web3, blockchain, and token contract development. I've
      learned the intricacies of NFT minting, buying, and selling logic, which
      has opened up new possibilities in the world of decentralized
      applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to technical skills, I've also developed a strong
      understanding of web design principles and user experience. I can create
      visually appealing and highly functional websites that cater to the needs
      of users and clients alike. My ability to deploy websites using GitHub
      Pages ensures that my projects are always accessible and live for the
      world to see.
    </p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>
      As part of my course, I have built a portfolio of over 32 websites, each
      showcasing different aspects of my abilities. These projects range from
      simple, static pages to complex, dynamic applications. They demonstrate my
      capability to work with various technologies and my commitment to
      producing high-quality work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every project I undertake is an opportunity to learn something new and
      improve my skills. Whether it's fine-tuning the responsiveness of a layout
      using Flexbox and Grid, or implementing robust authentication systems with
      Firebase, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and a problem-solving
      mindset.
    </p>

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to leverage my skills to create impactful web applications that
      not only meet the technical requirements but also provide an exceptional
      user experience. I believe that a well-designed website can be a powerful
      tool for businesses and individuals alike, and I strive to deliver
      solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am excited about the future of web development and the endless
      possibilities it holds. With a solid foundation in traditional web
      technologies and a growing expertise in emerging fields like blockchain, I
      am well-prepared to tackle a wide range of projects. I look forward to
      collaborating with like-minded professionals and contributing to
      innovative web solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore my projects and
      reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
